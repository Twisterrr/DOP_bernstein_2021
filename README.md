This DevOps project will introduce an important, albeit more advanced, notion in DevOps: orchestration.
 * How to use a very widely used, Google-made, orchestration solution: Kubernetes.
 * How to define pods, deployments, services, and more to craft your own application orchestra, entirely managed by Kubernetes.

In the end, you will have a solid symphony of containers being automatically started and stopped, serving an application that can be professionally scaled. And that is even more superest cooler.

# Definition

**Orchestration** is the arrangement of a piece of music in parts so that it can be played by an orchestra (from the
Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary).
In other terms, it is the process of organizing the different components of a system in order for them to be
(correctly) executed by a generic infrastructure

# Environment 

You will need at least 1 Kubernetes master and 2 nodes (workers). You can run it locally, but it is highly recommended to use a “Kubernetes as a Service” platform.

Examples of such platforms include (but are not limited to) Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service,Google Ku-bernetes Engine, Digital Ocean...

Installing a full Kubernetes cluster locally is complex. Minikube is also not built for multi-node clusters (which you needfor your project).
